<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
HappyDays is a program for Palm hand-held computers. It helps you to
remember the birthdays or anniversaries of your friends and
family. It gathers information from the built-in AddressBook application and
exports notification record into the built-in Datebook, To Do or Memo Pad 
application.  It supports the same categories as defined in 
the AddressBook.

<h2><a name="installation">Installing HappyDays</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Obtain the HappyDays distribution file (you've probably done this
      already, since you're reading this manual)
  <li>Extract the distribution file (a .ZIP archive) into the directory you
      wish to keep the files in. You don't need to keep the extracted files
      after the installation, but you may wish to keep them so as to have the
      Manual available to you in the future.
  <li> Install the happydays.prc file into your Palm OS device  
</ol>

<h2><a name="data_format">Input Data format of HappyDays</a></h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> This data format is used when you input information in the custom field
or note field in Address Book. 
 The date format is automatically read from the system preferences.<br>
If you input the information in wrong date format, you will encounter
'Invalid event format' error message. 

If the first
entry in this field starts with a digit, HappyDays will read this
information. An example is:<p>

<pre>
12/31/1970
</pre>

You can omit the year field. Year input below 100 is assumed to be year
in 20th century. If you are not sure of the year format, just write it in
form of YYYY(e.g. 1970). <b>Year must be in 1904 and 2301</b>, because
HappyDays use the built-in date type of Palm OS for reducing DB size <p>

If you want to input lunar date information, prepend '-)' or '#)' before
date. '-)' means by date according to the lunar calendar, and '#)' means by
the lunar leap month according to the lunar calendar.<p>

If you checked "Scan addr notes" in your Preferences settings, HappyDays
will look for events in the notes attached to your Address Book records,
too. This was intended to support multiple lines for a whole family and
multiple types of events. There is no reason why the custom field shouldn't
contain multiple lines, too. So both the notes field and the custom-field
are checked for multiple lines in the event Format described further
below.<p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When 'System/Prefs/Formats/Date' is 'Y/M/D'.
      <pre>
      1980/1/31        Jan, 31, 1980(the solar calendar)
      5/30             May, 30(the solar calendar)
      -)1970/12/4      Dec. 4, 1970(the lunar calendar)
      </pre>
      
  <li>When Date format is 'D.M.Y'
      <pre>
      31.1.80          Jan, 31, 1980(the solar calendar)
      30.5 or 30.5.    May, 31(the solar calendar)
      </pre>

</ul>

<h3>Format of Event entries</h3>

HappyDays expects a multi-line entry of a custom field or a note to look like:

<pre>
* Jaemok 12/31/1970
* Sumiae 1/1/1945
*Wedding Mother&Father 3/23/1940
</pre>

Each event in the note or field should be on a separate line. The lines need
to start with a "*" to be recognized by HappyDays. Each line consists of
three fields which should be delimited by one or more blanks.

<pre>
First field: Type of event ("*" for default event) 
Second field: Name of Person/event (e.g. Jaemok)
Third field: Initial Date of event (e.g. 12/31/1970)
</pre>

There may be no extra blanks in each field! So the type of event needs
to go directly with the first "*", (e.g. "*Wedding", "*Holiday") If the name
of the person or event consists of more than one word, use an
underscore(e.g. "Grand_father"). Underscore is automatically interpreted
into space ' '. <b>If you don't want to display a last name, add a dot('.')
before the event name.</b> <p>

<h3>Examples - Anniversaries</h3>

<p> If you want to register anniversary such as New_Year or
Thanksgiving_Lunar, you can insert this data in one AddressBook entry.
For your information, Lunar
date is changed every year. 

<pre>
Last name: Anniversary
...
...
Birthday: * New_Years_Day 1/1
* New_Years_Lunar -)1/1
*Event Father's_Day 8/2
* .Thanksgiving_Lunar -)8/15
...
</pre>

<p>
In HappyDays list view, you can see the following.
<pre>
...
Anniversary,New Years Day        00/1/1  -B
Anniversary,New Years Lunar      00/2/5  -B
Anniversary,Father's Day         00/8/2  -E

In this screen, '-' means that HappyDays couldn't calculate the age of the
event, because the year is not provided. The last char 'B' is the initial of
the event type. In this example, 'B' means 'Birthday', the default event type.
'E' means 'Event'. If you don't want to display a last name, add a dot('.')
before the event name.



<h3><a name="note_field">Using note field of Address Book for input
data</a></h3> 

In the preferences menu, there is 'Scan from note field' control. Check this
check box and HappyDays will search the note field in address book. Because
note field in address book is sometimes used to keep another information,
HappyDays searches the only region from HappyDays identifier(which is '*HD:'
string) to another HappyDays identifier or end of notes. That is, HappyDays
stop scanning on seeing the end marker or end of notes(whichever comes
first).

<h2><a name="tips">Some useful tips</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li> Name1 & name2 displayed in HappyDays List is determined by
      'AddressBook/Preferences/List by'. If you change this preferences,
      you can see the different views.

  <li> You can see the sorted view by tapping on 'D,N,A' button in bottom of
      HappyDays screen. If you tap 'A' button again, age sorting order is
      changed into ascending/descending order.
      
  <li> If you write character or number in graffiti area, the matching row is
      highlighted. For example, if you write 'a' in graffiti, the first record
      beginning with 'a' or 'A' is highlighted. If you write '1' in graffiti,
      the nearest incoming record after January is highlighted.
      
  <li> In case of Solar event, Date field is omitted, because the date field
      is redundant. Since the entry is made on *that* day already, this text
      is kind of superfluous. For lunar event, Date field is displayed because
      the actual solar day is changed every year. And 'AGE' is displayed if
      possible. If entry date doesn't have year field or repeating is set for
      solar event, this field is omitted. If you want to see 'AGE' field, set
      'repeat for' to 1.
      
  <li> You can look up the past or future event using 'Lookup' selector.
      
  <li> In 'HappyDays View' screen, you can move the previous/next record
      using hardware up/down button. And you could use Jog dial to traverse
      record
      
</ul>
