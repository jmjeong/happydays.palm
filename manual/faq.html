<p>
If you want to display the age of the person, you must notify the date into
datebook with 'repeat for' 1. If 'repeat for' is more than 2 or -1, recurring
event(only one record) is created in datebook. Then you will see the
same age every year. So I changed the age into year in this case.

Not yet. It will be supported in the next release. But I don't know
when it will be released. :-) <br>
But there is a way to do this in original date book.(Contributed by Mitra YIP)
<ol>
<li> Create a new meeting on the first Monday of September this year.
<li> Set it as repeat Monthly by Day and repeat for every 12 months.

<p>
To translate HappyDays in your favorite language, you need to
download the latest HappyDays source
file from <a

page</a>.
<br>
Copy english.msg to translate.msg and edit translate.msg file.
Translate the right part(i.e. the phases after '=') into your
favorite language.

If you are working on it, please let <a

<p>
In HappyDays, user can select either 'keep' or 'modify' of record during
notification. A number in the note section is used for determining whether two
records are the same or not.
<p>
In previous version of HappyDays, I used 'string compare' algorithm to decide
that. Since HappyDays 1.2 version, user can select the favorite notification
format among several candidate. It becomes hard and time-consuming to decide
it. So I use hash(well-known as good functionality) algorithm to map
address book's user name into one long integer. With it, HappyDays can easily
determine whether several records belongs to the same address book.

<p>
There is no ways to add data directly in HappyDays. For the time being, there
is no plan to add such a feature. I have thought that the current input method
has some advantages over directly input method.
<ol>
<li>We could use Palm Desktop to add a lot of data for using HappyDays.
  That is, there is no need to have another conduit program.
<li>It is easy to keep the integrity of data.
<li>Program size. :-)

<p>
I don't know the detail mechanism to number Action Names Icon.
But there is the easy way to know the AN icon number for AN events.
Make the NEW MEETING with the appropriate icon in ActionNames Datebook.
And open the built-in Date Book and look up the created event.
You can see the AN icon number in the note field of the searched record.

According to korean calendar, 27-Apr-2001 in lunar falls on 20-May-2001 in
solar date. </p>
<p>
Thers is a good explanation about this problem by Dr. Yi-nan Chin.<br>
<pre>
(--- Excerpts from his mail --)

This is Yi-nan Chin and I am a professor of astronomy working at Tamkang
University, Taipei, Taiwan.  I am also a user of the HappyDays software for
Palm which developed by you and translated to Chinese by Daitau Aaron.  Just
today I read the FAQ and notice a problem that most of the users may not
pay attention to: which date is 20-May-2001 in the lunar calendar? 27-04-2001?
or 28-04-2001?  (I use Jan, Feb for west (solar) calendar and number for east
(you call it lunar) calendar to avoid the mis-understanding.)  The answer is:
both are correct!!  Why?!  According to the rule of calendat set by the
Chinese astronomers in Han Dynasty, every month should start with a new moon.
That means, new moon is always located to the first day of a month.  However,
there is one hour time different between Korea and Taiwan (as well as China).
Just happened in 2001, one of the new moons is at 23:26 of 23-Apr-2001 in
Taiwan, at the same time it was already 00:26 of 24-Apr-2001.  According to
the rule of the traditional calendar, 01-04-2001 is 23-Apr-2001 in Taiwan and
24-Apr-2001 in Korea.  So, 27-04-2001 is 19-May-2001 in Taiwan but 20-May-2001
in Korea.  That means, there were 30 days in the 4th month of 2001 in Taiwan
according to the traditional calendar, but only 29 days in Korea, since the
next month (the 5th) starts on the same day again (10:46 of 23-May-2001 in
Taiwan and 11:46 in Korea).  I hope this explain you why the difference.
I remember a couple of years ago, the new year started in Taiwan on 7-Feb-1997
but on 8-Feb-1997 in Korea.  This is caused by the same reason.  Fortunately,
if new moon happens randomly at any time, the probability that Korea and
Taiwan
have difference should be 1/24 (one hour difference devided by the lenth of a
day.)  If we use the same rule but according to a time zone which is very
far away from us, it will be hard to have similar calendar!!

Furthermore, it's not a lunar calendar -- the traditional calendar set 2000
years ago is actually a solar-luni calendar -- it considers both the motion
of the sun and the moon.  That's why I call it neither lunar calendar nor
agricultural calendar, but just traditional calendar.  So, please also notice
the leap month.  It is set by the sun-earth relative position and it can
happen again that this timing falls in two different dates in Taiwan and Korea
which caused by the 1 hour differece between these two time zone.  As a
consequence the leap month can even on the different month.

So, Mr. Daitau Aaron, I know it's a hard work, but to make HappyDays useful
for
Taiwanese and Chinese (we have the same time zone) it's not enough just to
translate the language, but also check some of the data base.

Also -- the number of month in this traditional calendar should NOT be
translated to Jan., Feb., etc.  If you have learnt some Latin, you will notice
September, October, November, December actually mean the 7th, 8th, 9th and
10th month, respectively.  This is a long history why it became 9th, 10th,
11th and 12th month now a day.

I hope this explanation is helpful for you.
