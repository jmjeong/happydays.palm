<li> <b>HappyDays 1.45</b>(5/28/2001)
    <ul>
      <li> Due to the restriction in the desktop software, all birthdays before
          1970 must be entered in the database as appointments in 1970. But under
          some Hotsync manager, it is reported that repeating entries created by HappyDays 
          can crash Hotsync operation. 
          
          So I changed all birthdays before 1990 must
          be entered in the database as appointments in 1990.

          <ul>
            <li>If global find is performed without HappyDaysDB, fatal error

<li> <b>HappyDays 1.41</b>(3/2/2001) - Support global find 
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.4</b>(2/1/2001) 
    <ul>
      <li> Fix a bug relating to menu shortcut. In the previous version, 
          '/' + A or other shortcut do not work because of the conflict with 
          the graffiti searching.
      <li> Replace the sorting interface<br>
          You can see the sorted view by tapping on table header(Name, Date, and
          Age). In case of Age, you can see it on ascending/descending order.
          The interface of tapping 'abc', '123' on graffiti area is eliminated
          to prevent the conflict with other applications like Jot or
          FitalyStamp etc.
      <li> Add some help string in Tips menu 
      <li> Enhance hash function to reduce the hash conflict. <br>
          Because of this change, you must clean up the existing DateBook
          record and re-notify DateBook record. Or you will see the duplicate
          record of HappyDays in DateBook.
      <li>Change of About screen.

    </ul>
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.36</b>(10/5/2000) <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix a bug reported by Y.C. Lee.<br>
          If future event(e.g. 10/5/2010) is entered into Happydays,
          the event is shown in current year. It should be displayed 
          in year 2010.
    </ul>
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.35</b>(10/2/2000) <br>
    Bug fix relating to To Do Notify
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.34</b>(8/29/2000) <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Fix a bug relating to leap year(Reported by Richard Czech)<br>
          If birthday is February 29 and recurring DateBook
          entries is generated, HappyDays generate an entry for
          2/29/70, which is wrong, as 1970 wasn't a leap year.
      <li>DateBk3/4 icon can now be read regardless of the private setting.
    </ul>
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.32</b>(7/26/2000) <br>

<li> <b>HappyDays 1.3</b>(6/30/2000) <br>
    <ul>
      <li>HappyDays Icon is changed (Thanks Alan Hecht)
      <li>To be compatible with SuperNames 1.51 that add link information to
          end of the notes, an end marker(*HD:, which is the same as the
          start marker) is added. HappyDays stop scanning on seeing the end
          marker or end of notes(whichever comes first). (Suggested by "Y.C.
          Lee" &lt;y.c.lee@motorola.com&gt;)
      <li>Change 'up/down' button behavior. After scrolling the page, you
          can see the last record of previous screen.
      <li>Because HD's db is automatically generated from address book, HD's
          db is now not backuped.
      <li>You can see the elapsed days from
          the staring event and the remaining days until the next incoming
          event in 'HappyDays View' screen.

          <ul>

            <li>Notification bug. Because after hotsync the record identifier of
                AddressBook is changed, the same notification record is
                considered the different one. I changed the notification scheme.

                McCollister&lt;Mike_McCollister@msn.com&gt;

    <ul>
      <li>Internal data format is changed used for notification. You may not
          delete the old data with the new version. Before
          installing the new version, delete the old data with the current
          version. 
      <li>User can select one of following 'notification description'(Suggested
          by "Rob D Johansen"&lt;Rob_D_Johansen@notes.seagate.com&gt;).
          <pre>
          [Last, First] *E1 Year     : [Jeong, JaeMok] B 1970 (31)
          [First Last] *E1 Year      : [JaeMok Jeong] B 1970 (31)
          Event - Last, First Year   : Birthday - Jeong, JaeMok 1970 (31)
          Event - First Last Year    : Birthday - JaeMok Jeong 1970 (31)

          </pre>
      <li>ToDo notification support (todo category, priority) 
      <li>Graffiti searching(Suggested by
          "Vince Rice" &lt;vrice@solidrocksystems.com&gt;).<br>
          If you write character or number in graffiti area, the matching row is
          highlighted. It can be useful with 'sort'. For example, if you
          write 'a' in graffiti, the first record beginining with 'a' or
          'A' is highlighted. If you write '1' in graffiti, the nearest
          incoming record after January is highlighted.
      <li>Progress dialog is displayed in doing a long notification
          work(Suggested by "Hugh Harries" &lt;harries@cicy.mx&gt;).
      <li>In preference menu, 'sort by' control is disappeared.
          You can sort the happydays entries only by graffiti 'abc' and '123'.
      <li>Preference record has the version number. You don't need to
          uninstall the old version any more. 
      <li>Code optimize and a minor bug fix in displaying datebk3 icon.
      <li>Fix some minor bug(eg. boundary check error in recurring event).
    </ul>
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.13</b>(4/12/2000) <br>
    For the recurring events before 1970, HappyDays make the recurring event 
    in 1970.  Because Palm Desktop doesn't support the events before 1970.
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.12</b>(4/10/2000) <br>
    <ul>
      <li> If you tap 'abc' in graffiti area, HappyDays List is sorted by
          name. If you tab '123' in graffiti area, HappyDays List is sorted by
          date. 
      <li> Change some of text string.
    </ul>
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.11</b>(4/6/2000) <br> 
    <ul>

          information from AddressBook(Thanks David).
      <li> Changes the shortcut of preference menu to 'P'.
    </ul>
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.1</b> (4/5/2000) <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Supports AN icon(ICON number based)
      <li> Supports DateBk3 icon<br>
          If you have a datebk3 icon in memo pad, icons are displayed. And
          you can select the icon from screen.
      <li> Changes a behavior of 'name sort'. HappyDays list is sorted by
          name not by Address Book's order.
      <li> Options to hide HD identifier field(to note field). 
      <li> User can determine output format of multiple entry(last names
          have returned!!!).<br>
          If you don't want to display a last name, add a dot before
          event name.
    </ul>
    
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.03</b> (3/21/2000) <br>
    Corrects minor bug relating to StartForm.(If custom field doesn't
    exist in Address Book, user can go to Preference Settings from
    StartForm. However, after user updates custom field in Preference
    Settings, HappyDays doesn't read Address Book DB.)
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.02</b> (3/17/2000) - Contributed by Roger Chaplin
    <ul>
      <li>Compiled using SDK 3.5
      <li>
          System date format preference is used to format the display of
          dates and exporting the list to Memo Pad. A separate date
          format variable is used to control the interpretation of the
          AddressDB Birthday custom field. By default this is the same as
          the system date format preference, but users can change it in
          Preferences.
    </ul>
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.01</b> (3/1/2000) <br>
    Display year field if repeating is on in case of solar event.
<li> <b>HappyDays 1.0</b> (2/28/2000)
    <ul>
      <li> The name 'Birthdate+' is changed(the new name is suggested by
          djek).
          
      <li> Source code is aranged for an easy porting to localized
          version and a few duplicated code are fixed to reduce a size of program.
      <li> User can select an alarm time in  Notify Setting screen.
      <li> Date format in 'solar to lunar' and 'lunar to solar' is
          determined by system date format. User can go to Edit menu from
          this screen.
      <li> Some help text has changed.
      <li> If user set the 'Repeat for' field to -1 or more than 2,
          notification entry for solar event date is set not on next
          occurrence, but to the specified date in HappyDays. For
          example, if solar date is 5/3/1970 and user sets the 'Repeat
          for' to two, repeating event starts on 5/3/1970.
      <li> The format of the notification has changed.
          <pre>
          Format: '['NAME']' {HD id}{Event Type} [DATE] [(AGE)]
          </pre>

          HD identifier is reconfigurable from Preference menu, and is used for
          Clean up Happydays records. Without it, program can't tell HappyDays
          records from others. And instead of 'Datebook' in notification menu, only
          'Datebk3 icon' checkbox exists, because the record format is for Action
          Names and can be used in other DateBook clone.<br>

          In case of Solar event, Date field is omitted, for the date field is
          redundant. Since the entry is made on *that* day already, this text is
          kind of superfluous. For lunar event, Date field is displayed because the
          actual solar day is changed every year.<br>

          '(AGE)' is displayed if possible. If entry date doesn't have year field
          or repeating is set for solar event, this field is omitted.<br>

      <li> Export to Memo Pad Menu
          The comma separated list can be created as memo pad entry and can be
          imported, for example, in Excel after a HotSync.
      <li> Every "_" is interpreted as a " " in multiple entry, i.e. "Father's
          Day" instead of "Father's_Day"? It is applied to Event type also. 
      <li> If user changes system security setting, the HappyDays database is 
          rebuilt for privacy.
      <li> Date format becomes more flexible.<br>
          In Europe - if we omit the year of a birthdate - it is written as "DD.MM." 
          (e.g.  24.12. for 24th of December). So HappyDays accepts two format both,
          "DD.MM" or "DD.MM."
      <li> HappyDays list view is changed
          Displaying "Father's_Day" would be better than "Anniversary,
          Father's_Day".
    </ul>
</ul>
