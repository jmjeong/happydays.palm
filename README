Overview
--------

HappyDays is an application for the Palm family of hand-held computers. 
It is yet another Birthdate clone.  HappyDays will help you remember 
the birthdays and anniversaries of your friends and family members. 
HappyDays is free to use and licensed under the GNU General Public License.

HappyDays is a work in progress. If you have any suggestions for improvement
or found a bug in the program, please email

I started with a Birthdate clone mostly because I liked its 
interface. I hope nobody is offended that I 'borrowed' the layout of birthdate.


Features
--------
  * Reads the relevant information from the built-in Address Book and
	  shows the birthdate and the events on the screen.
  * Exports the event into the built-in Date Book application.
  * Exports birthdate list to the built-in Memo Pad application.
  * Supports the lunar calendar (useful for Asian users).
  * Supports repeat and alarm in the notification record
  * Supports international date format (in system preference)
  * Supports Action Names and DateBk3 formats as well as built-in Date Book
  * Tested with Gremlins!(Palm OS2, Palm OS3).

p.s. Because the record format for notification is changed, the new program
can not delete the old notification record. If you won't keep the old
record, you had better delete it using old Birthda+ 0.96.


ChangeLog(from Birthdate+ 0.96)
-------------------------------

* The name 'Birthdate+' is changed.
* Source code is aranged for an easy porting to localized version and a few
duplicated code are fixed to reduce a size of program.
* User can select an alarm time in  Notify Setting screen.
* Date format in 'solar to lunar' and 'lunar to solar' abides by system
date format. User can go to Edit menu from this screen.
* Some help text has changed.
* If user set the 'Repeat for' field to -1 or more than 2, notification entry
for solar event date is set not on next appearence, but on Birthdate date.
For example, if solar date is 5/3/1970 and user sets the 'Repeat for' to two,
repeating event starts on 5/3/1970.
* The format of notification is changed.

Format: '['NAME']' {HD id}{Event Type} [DATE] [(AGE)]

  HD identifier is reconfigurable from Preference menu, and is used for
  Clean up Happydays records. Without it, program can't tell HappyDays
  records from others. And instead of 'Datebook' in notification menu, only
  'Datebk3 icon' checkbox will exist, because this record format is for AN
  and can be used in other DateBook clone.

  In case of Solar event, Date field is omitted, for the date field is
  redundant. Since the entry is made on *that* day already, this text is
  kind of superfluous. For lunar event, Date field is displayed because the
  actual solar day is changed every year.

  '(AGE)' is displayed if possible. If entry date doesn't have year field
  or repeating is set for solar event, this field is omitted.

* Export to Memo Pad Menu
  The comma separated list can be created as memo pad entry and can be
  imported, for example, in Excel after a HotSync.
* Every "_" is interpreted as a " " in multiple entry, i.e. "Father's
  Day" instead of "Father's_Day"? It is applied to Event type. 
* If user changes system security setting, DB in HappyDays is rebuild for
  privacy.
* Date format becomes more flexible.
   In Europe - if we omit the year of a birthdate - we write "DD.MM." (e.g.
   24.12. for 24th of December). So HappyDays accepts two format both,
   "DD.MM" or "DD.MM."
* HappyDays list view is changed
  The Father's_Day event is shown with "Anniversary, Father's_Day". I think
 that displaying "Father's_Day" would be better than "Anniversary,
 Father's_Day".
