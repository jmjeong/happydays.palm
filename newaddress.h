/**
 * @file AddressDB.h
 *
 * @brief Contains database record type and constants for Contacts application.
 *
 * Contacts application uses a different record format than the old AddressBook
 * application due to some feature enhancement and new data fields. This file
 * contains the structure of the record in Contacts DB and can be used to access
 * the database directly. One way to utilize this header file is to combine it
 * with the old Address Book source code so that the record packing and
 * unpacking routines are adjusted for the new structure.
 *
 * Please note that accessing the database directly is generally not recommended
 * and this is offered as a temporary solution for 3rd party developers. The
 * structure might change again in the future.
