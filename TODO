Only the day and the month, but not the year is redundant in the date book
entry. I would, therefor, prefer that the year is shown in the
 datebook entry (if the event is created as repeating event). By showing the
year it is easy to know how old the person will be on this
 day. This is of course not necessary with not repeating events since in this
case the actual age can be shown in the datebook.

It's right for Father's_Day but now all family birthday entries (I mean the
cases, when I have several people in the birthdate field of
 my address book using "*" and the first name) are created without the
surname. Only the first name is shown in the HappyDays list view,
 the HappyDays detail view, the exported memo pad entry and even in the
created datebook entry. If you know several people having
 the same fist name you never know whose birthdate is...
 Could it be a solution to create an address book entry for the anniversaries
by inputting "Anniversary" not in the surname field but for
 example in the "title" or "company" field leaving the surname field blank.
Thus, the anniversaries will be shown without "surname" and
 the names of real person will be shown with the surname.

On further suggestion for the next release:
 It should be easier to switch in the list view between name and date sorting.
One quick solution could be to have one (toggle) menu
 option or two menu options (one for date and one for name sorting) which can
be accessed with a shortcut. If the shortcut does not need
 to be preceeded by the "/" (as some programs do it) by input only one
character the sorting could be switched.

Also, another to-do is to give option of whether a user prefers "Event,
Korean New Year" or "Korean New Year". :-D

I use an Address Replacement call TealPhone. How to I get HappyDays to use it
instead of the built-in?
