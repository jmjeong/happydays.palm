/*
 * FUNCTION: lunar_OpenLibrary
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * User-level call to open the library.  This inline function
 * handles the messy task of finding or loading the library
 * and calling its open function, including handling cleanup
 * if the library could not be opened.
 * 
 * PARAMETERS:
 *
 * refNumP
 *		Pointer to UInt16 variable that will hold the new
 *      library reference number for use in later calls
 *
 * clientContextP
 *		pointer to variable for returning client context.  The client context is
 *		used to maintain client-specific data for multiple client support.  The 
 *		value returned here will be used as a parameter for other library 
 *		functions which require a client context.  
 *
 * CALLED BY: System
 *
 * RETURNS:
 *		errNone
 *		memErrNotEnoughSpace
 *      sysErrLibNotFound
 *      sysErrNoFreeRAM
 *      sysErrNoFreeLibSlots
 *
 * SIDE EFFECTS:
 *		*clientContextP will be set to client context on success, or zero on
 *      error.

 *		client context (as returned by the open call)

 * CALLED BY: Whoever wants to close the library
